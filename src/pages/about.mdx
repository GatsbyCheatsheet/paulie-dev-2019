# About Me

A long time ago I was a designer, and then after a few years I realised code is just better. Iâ€™ve held various positions in and around advertising and web development in both permanent and contract positions since 2005.

You can read more about my story [here](https://www.pauliescanlon.io/about/) and for more information about my work visit my [commercial portfolio](http://www.pauliescanlon.io/)
